## Installation and Set Up
Prerequisites:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [VS Code Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Optional:
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

Clone the repo from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/mccarthysean/Flask-Dash-Plotly-TimescaleDB-Docker-Swarm-Traefik.git
or use GitHub Desktop software for an easy, user-friendly experience
```

Rename the .env_template to .env and fill in the security credentials

Open the folder in VS Code

If you've got Docker Desktop and the VS Code Remote Development Extension Pack installed already, VS Code should ask if you want to reopen the project in a Docker container. Say yes. It will install the required packages for you. 

When VS Code asks you, select the Python 3.8 interpreter at /usr/local/bin/python

## Built With...
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
